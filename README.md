Abstract
Vision-based driver assistance systems are designed, and implemented in modern vehicles, for improving safety and better comfort. This report reviews areas of research on vision-based driver assistance systems and covers our work on systems of object detection and tracking of cars and pedestrian with much more other optional functionalities, using YoloV3, Keras, OpenCV... As weâ€™re in the first phase of a big project, this report also provides an extensive bibliography for the discussed subjects
Introduction
Most road accidents occur due to human error; Advanced driver-assistance systems are systems developed to automate, adapt, and enhance vehicle systems for safety and better driving. The automated system which is provided by ADAS to the vehicle is proven to reduce road fatalities, by minimizing human error. Safety features are designed to avoid collisions and accidents by offering technologies that alert the driver to potential problems or to avoid collisions by implementing safeguards and taking over control of the vehicle. 
Assignment and Project Approach: 
It is in this context that we are working in this business project on the PPP functionality. the project is in its infancy, and it already leads us to master many essential concepts. To take the first steps towards artificial intelligence and in turn, we are not just trying to implement some algorithms and get some results. Instead, we are trying to write a report that would be used as a reference for our fellow students. A reference that groups theory and practice. We will try to make things look as easy as possible.
